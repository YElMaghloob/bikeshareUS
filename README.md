The US Bikeshare dataset comprises data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

For each city, the following data is provided:

* End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
* Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)

* End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
* User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

Based on user input, the code imports the data relevant to the user specifications (city and time period) and computes descriptive statistics for the imported data.
